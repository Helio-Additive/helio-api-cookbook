# Large-Format Pellet Workflows

Placeholder for workflow recipes targeting large-format pellet printers and
pellet extrusion systems.

## Status

Planned. No workflows available yet.

## Scope

Future workflows in this domain may cover:

- Pellet printer simulation with large-format-specific parameters
- Optimization for pellet extrusion flow rates and velocity profiles
- Material-specific workflows for pellet feedstocks

## Contributing

If you have access to a pellet printer supported by Helio, we welcome
contributions. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines
and use the [workflow template](../_template/) as a starting point.
